# jsdom-worker

This is an experimental implementation of the Web Worker API (specifically Dedicated Worker) for JSDOM.

It does not currently do any real threading, rather it implements the `Worker` interface but all work is done in the current thread.  `jsdom-worker` runs wherever JSDOM runs, and does not require Node.

It supports both "inline" _(created via Blob)_ and standard _(loaded via URL)_ workers.

> **Hot Take:** this module likely works in the browser, where it could act as a simple inline worker "poorlyfill".

## Why?

Jest uses a JSDOM environment by default, which means it doesn't support Workers. This means it is impossible to test code that requires both NodeJS functionality _and_ Web Workers.  `jsdom-worker` implements enough of the Worker spec that it is now possible to do so.

## Installation

`npm i jsdom-worker`

## Example

```js
import 'jsdom-global/register'
import 'jsdom-worker'

let code = `onmessage = e => postMessage(e.data*2)`
let worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([code])))
worker.onmessage = console.log
worker.postMessage(5)  // 10
```

## Usage with Jest

For single tests, simply add `import 'jsdom-worker'` to your module.

Otherwise, add it via the [setupFiles](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#setupfiles-array) Jest config option:

```js
{
  "setupFiles": [
    "jsdom-worker"
  ]
}
```
